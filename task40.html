<!-- Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.
     The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a 
     Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries 
     representing different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing 
     the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you 
     to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the
      number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function 
      call that includes the number of 
    tracks on an album.
