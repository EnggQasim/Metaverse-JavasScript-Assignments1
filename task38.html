<!-- Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the 
    name of a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence,
     such as Karachi is in Pakistan. Give the parameter for the country a default value.
      Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the 
      default country.
