    Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
     The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should 
     then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the
      required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional
       feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored
        correctly.
