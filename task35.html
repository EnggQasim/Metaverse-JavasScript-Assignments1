  Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
   Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name
    of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog 
    would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals 
    have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great 
    pet!
