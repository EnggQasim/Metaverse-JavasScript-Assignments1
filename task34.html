  Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array,
   and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
â€¢ Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing 
just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a
 simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.
